Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle

Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand"
Feature toggles/flags,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"A feature toggle is a software development process used to enable or disable functionality remotely without deploying code. New features can be deployed without making them visible to users. Feature flags help decouple deployment from release letting you manage the full lifecycle of a feature.
Their purpose is to use known information to control how code works. For example, if new features are made available to internal users for testing and feedback, a feature flag can control this access. Any employee logged into the application with a corporate email address will see the feature; other users do not.
Feature flags eliminate the need to maintain multiple feature branches within your source code. All code changes can be made to the primary branch, only when the feature is ready will it be enabled via the flag.
To prevent complex capability matrices from spawning, toggles should be removed as soon as a feature has been adopted. Differential usage for the user population should be managed using permissions long-term."

Service mesh,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"A service mesh is a configurable, low‑latency infrastructure layer designed to handle a high volume of network‑based interprocess communication among application infrastructure services using application programming interfaces (APIs). A service mesh ensures that communication among containerized and often ephemeral application infrastructure services is fast, reliable, and secure. The mesh provides critical capabilities including service discovery, load balancing, encryption, observability, traceability, authentication and authorization, and support for the circuit breaker pattern.

The service mesh is usually implemented by providing a proxy instance, called a sidecar, for each service instance. Sidecars handle interservice communications, monitoring, and security‑related concerns – indeed, anything that can be abstracted away from the individual services. This way, developers can handle development, support, and maintenance for the application code in the services; operations teams can maintain the service mesh and run the app."
Homomorphic Encryption & other Differential Privacy Techniques,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Fully homomorphic encryption (HE) refers to a class of encryption methods that allow computations (such as search and arithmetic) to be performed directly on encrypted data. The result of such a computation remains in encrypted form, which at a later point can be decrypted and revealed. Although the HE problem was first proposed in 1978, a solution wasn't constructed until 2009. With advances in computing power and the availability of easy-to-use open-source libraries — including SEAL, Lattigo, HElib and partially homomorphic encryption in Python — HE is becoming feasible in real-world applications. The motivating scenarios include privacy-preserving use cases, where computation can be outsourced to an untrusted party, for example, running computation on encrypted data in the cloud, or enabling a third party to aggregate homomorphically encrypted intermediate federated machine learning results.

AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning. The high degree of automation in AutoML allows non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring them to become experts in machine learning. Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models. AutoML has been used to compare the relative importance of each factor in a prediction model"
